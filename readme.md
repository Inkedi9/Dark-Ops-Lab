> Learn. Practice. Attack. Defend.

Dark Ops Lab is a cybersecurity training platform that unifies learning, offensive practice, and defensive simulation into a single immersive environment — one application, one profile, one progression system.

---

## What is Dark Ops Lab?

Most security platforms isolate learning from practice. Dark Ops Lab connects them through a shared operator identity, a unified progression model, and a continuous feedback loop between offense and defense.

```
Understand → Exploit → Defend
```

Users learn vulnerabilities through guided lessons, exploit them in sandboxed offensive labs, then analyze and defend against them through SOC-inspired workflows — all from the same profile and session.

## Architecture

### Monorepo — single application

Four originally separate apps (DarkSplaining, DarkChallenges, DarkDefend, DarkNexus) were consolidated into a single Next.js application. All sections share the same origin, which means localStorage, session, and authentication are natively unified — no cross-domain synchronization.

```
Dark Ops Lab/
├── apps/
│   ├── dark-nexus/          ← Next.js 16 App Router — main application
│   └── dark-api/            ← Go backend — server-side validation & leaderboard
└── packages/

## Tech Stack

### Frontend — `apps/dark-nexus`

| Layer     | Technology                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Framework | Next.js 16.2 (App Router)               |
| Language  | TypeScript 5 (strict)                   |
| UI        | React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion |
| Icons     | Lucide React                            |
| Charts    | Recharts                                |
| Auth & DB | Supabase (GitHub OAuth, PostgreSQL)     |
| Storage   | localStorage via `@dark/storage`        |

### Backend — `apps/dark-api`

| Layer    | Technology                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Language | Go 1.23                               |
| Router   | chi v5                                |
| Auth     | Supabase JWT validation               |
| Database | Supabase (via REST API, service role) |

The Go backend handles operations that require server-side authority: **challenge flag validation** (flags are never sent to the client) and the **global leaderboard**. The frontend remains fully functional without the backend — unauthenticated users fall back to local validation.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Go 1.23+
- A Supabase project with GitHub OAuth configured

### Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp apps/dark-nexus/.env.local.example apps/dark-nexus/.env.local
# Fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

### Backend (optional)

The application works without the backend. Start it to enable server-side flag validation and the live leaderboard.

```bash
cd apps/dark-api

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

# Create your challenges config (server-side flags — never committed)
cp challenges.example.json challenges.json

# Run
go run ./cmd/server
```

---

## Progress & State Model

Progression is event-sourced. Every user action appends an idempotent progress event that is stored locally first, then synced to Supabase when the user is authenticated.

```json
{
  "namespace": "challenges",
  "type": "ctf_completed",
  "entityId": "ctf-internal-breach",
  "idempotencyKey": "challenges:ctf_completed:ctf-internal-breach",
  "payload": { "xp": 2500, "kind": "ctf" }
}
```

**Namespaces:** `learn` · `challenges` · `defend` · `nexus`

localStorage is the primary source of truth. Supabase sync is additive — data is never lost when offline.

---

## Supabase Integration

- GitHub OAuth (active)
- Profile persistence (`profiles` table)
- Progress events (`progress_events` table)
- App state snapshots (`app_progress_snapshots` table)
- Server-side challenge validation via `dark-api` (service role key)

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Server-side validation for Warzone scenarios
- [ ] Telemetry dashboards
- [ ] Attack maps & graph visualization
- [ ] Adaptive learning paths
- [ ] Verifiable completion certificates
- [ ] Global achievements
- [ ] Organization / team support
- [ ] AI-assisted exploit feedback (long-term)

---

## Philosophy

Learn by doing. Not by reading.

- Active exploration over passive content
- Simulation-first, realistic workflows
- Offense and defense in the same environment
- Local-first engineering — works without a backend or internet connection
- Modular architecture, single coherent product
